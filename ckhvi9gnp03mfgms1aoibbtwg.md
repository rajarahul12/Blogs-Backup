## 7 Things I do to stay productive while Working from Home

We are living in difficult times where Work from Home had become the new norm for Software Developers. The biggest challenge that people face while working from home is staying productive. After 8 months of working from home continuously and trying different techniques and methods, there are some of the techniques or ways I am following regularly that are helping me in staying productive at work as well as while learning.

*PS: If you don't have time to read the entire blog skip to the end of the blog and check out the section **In a nutshell***

### 1. Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length separated by short breaks. You might be thinking what's the benefit behind this? Well, there is actual science behind it.
For the 25 minutes, your brain goes into **Focus mode** where your brain processes very specific information deeply. When you take a break after that your brain will go into a **Diffuse mode** where it gets time to analyze the information at once but in less depth and make the neural connections strong. 

You can customize this technique to the way it works for you. I personally follow 45 min of focused work and 15 minutes break. For tracking the time I use  [Flow](https://flowapp.info/) app on my Mac and I put my phone on  [Zen Mode](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oneplus.brickmode&hl=en_IN&gl=US) (Available on OnePlus phones)  to avoid any distractions.


### 2. Active Learning

I use **Active Learning ** whenever I have to learn something whether it is related to work or personal learning. Whenever I try to learn something I try to make notes at regular intervals or I try to implement it alongside.

We can watch video tutorials, read articles, and other things for a very long time but without taking notes or implementing something related to that will deteriorate over time. This type of Learning is called **Passive Learning**. Passive Learning might look easy and helps us to finish things quickly but in the long run Active Learning is what saves our time as we might not need to revisit what we have learned completely.

*FYI:  For note-taking, I still use a notebook and a pen. Old school but I think it is still the most efficient way to jot something down.*


### 3. Exercise regularly

Not only exercise will help you in staying fit it will help your brain in getting relaxed. To reduce the stress, get out and workout or exercise every day. Even if it's just 20 minutes of running or jogging. Exercise will help clear your mind and keep you focused. You may think that being chained to your desk will mean that you get more things done, but it actually works against you. 

I am feeling more energized after started doing exercise daily. Working out for at least 5 days a week will bring a difference in your life. Start slow, like basic stretches and all, but doing it consistently makes the difference.


### 4. Sleep well

Getting enough sleep is one more important thing that helps you in staying productive. You might think why should I waste time sleeping but believe me I used to think of it the same way but there will be a lot of difference if you give your body enough rest. 

From the past few months, I started sleeping for at least 7-8 hours a day. This is enough for me, keeps me active without any fatigue for the whole day - Your's might vary as it varies from person to person.

*A good night's sleep will reflect on how productive you feel the next day, so ensure you make sleep a priority.*

### 5. Read Books

I have never been a person who reads a lot of books. I tried buying some books thinking if I buy them I might read them but I was not able to. I wanted to change that habit as books are the source of atmost knowledge so tried something different and started listening to audiobooks. This actually worked for me, Now I am constantly listening to them and it is also helping me in getting screen-off time during the day.

If you are like me then try audiobooks or e-books something might work for you as well.  Start with the topics that you like the most and then switch to the books that help in shaping your career.

These are some of the books that might help you in kick-starting your reading journey

### 6. Commit to a challenge

Challenging yourself is the best way to get the most of your time. Committing to code every day or 100 days of code or any other challenges like these will help you stay motivated and get the best out of you. 

I found myself more productive from the time I committed to 100 days of code. This kept me motivated and I pushed myself beyond the limits as I had to manage my work and complete the challenge. Find something like this that you think helps you in being motivated and commit to doing it right away. 

*As a matter of fact, at the time of writing this article, I am on the 90th Day of **100 days of code** challenge. So wish me good luck.*

If you are afraid of committing something that lasts for a long time try to break it down into small things like 10 Days of Code and by doing this 10 times you will eventually end up completing 100 Days of Code. *Chunk* your goals into small realistic goals that work for you does not matter how small as long as you are achieving something.


### 7. Track progress daily

Keeping a track of your progress helps you in staying focused. Track your every day wins like a workout, hours of learning, coding time, and other things you are doing to stay productive. At the end of the day when you see that you have finished today's goals, it will help you sleep better and wake up motivated.

To keep track of my goals I use an app called  [Stickk](https://www.stickk.com/)
